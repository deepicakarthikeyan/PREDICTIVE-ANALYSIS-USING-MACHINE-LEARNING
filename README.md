Task Description: Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning

The objective of this task is to perform predictive analysis using machine learning techniques to forecast outcomes based on historical data. Predictive analysis helps identify patterns and relationships within data, enabling informed decision-making across domains such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and operations.

In this task, a dataset is loaded into a Jupyter Notebook environment and prepared for analysis. The preprocessing stage includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if required, and scaling numerical features to ensure consistent model performance. Feature selection is then applied to identify the most relevant input variables that contribute significantly to the prediction target, reducing noise and improving model efficiency.

After feature selection, a machine learning model is trained using a supervised learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. During training, the model learns patterns from the training data and builds a predictive function.

Model evaluation is performed using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness and reliability of the predictive model. Visualization techniques may also be used to better interpret results.

The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the complete workflow, including feature selection, model training, and evaluation. This task provides practical experience in building and assessing predictive machine learning models and highlights the importance of data-driven prediction in real-world applications.
